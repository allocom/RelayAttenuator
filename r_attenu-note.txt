"r_attenu" program is derived from irexec program. All the features of irexec 
will work on r_attenu. Changes are added to handle the Relay Attenuator 
push-button switches. 
lircrc config file defines the actions for each key defined in lircd.config & 
push-button switches of relay attenuator (BUTTON1, BUTTON2, BUTTON3 and BUTTON4).
The 4 push-buttons (keys) on the relay attenuator is mapped as follows:

Push-buttons	Function
BUTTON1		Mute
BUTTON2		Play/Pause
BUTTON3		Volume down
BUTTON4		Volume up

e.g.:
begin
	button = BUTTON1
	prog = r_attenu
	config = hardware_control
	#config = sudo echo "mute" | telnet  127.0.0.1 9090  
end

Along with the standard implementation of fields, "config" field can handle 
"hardware_control" option, which instructs r_attenu to handle the events in the 
hardware.  Volume up/down and mute controls can be diverted to hardware 
(relay attenuator) board by using "hardware_control" keyword - in config 
parameter of specific button.

e.g.:
begin
	button = KEY_VOLUMEUP
	prog = r_attenu
	config = hardware_control
end
